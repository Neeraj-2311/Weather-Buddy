# Weather-Buddy

👋Hi! I'm Neeraj. Here are some insights of my project "weather buddy".

⚓ A Weather App with live location and 5-days forecast weather details.

⚓ Ipinfo Api is used to get user's location from their ip address. 

⚓ In this way it does not need location access from user.

⚓ "OpenWeatherMap api" and "WeatherApi" are used.

🎃 Core HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used.
