# Weather-Buddy

👋Hi! I'm Neeraj. Here are some insights of my project "weather buddy".

⚓ A Weather App with live location and 4-days forecast weather details. I made one earlier too but that was not good enough to showcase my skills.

⚓ Ipinfo Api is used to get user's location from their ip address. 

⚓ In this way it does not need location access from user.

⚓ "OpenWeatherMap api" is used.

🎃 Core HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used. Also used moment.js for date formatting.

🎃 I made this website highly responsive and informative.
